This repository contains mostly data science-related assignment solutions, in the form of Python code, Jupyter notebooks, and PDFs rendered from Jupyter markdown for derivations/proofs, as well as datasets as applicable.

### Table of folder contents

[OLS and GLM](https://github.com/yflim/data-science-work-samples/tree/master/OLS_and_GLM)
- OLS solution from scratch using gradient descent, with comparison against ready-made solution from statsmodels.
- Some related theory; also for GLM.

[Logistic regression](https://github.com/yflim/data-science-work-samples/tree/master/logistic_regression)
- Parameter MLE from scratch for logistic regression using the Newton-Raphson method, plus out-of-the-box Scikit-learn solution.

[Cross-validation](https://github.com/yflim/data-science-work-samples/tree/master/cross_validation)
- Leave-one-out and k-fold cross-validation methods for classification, efficiently recomputing moments (expectation and variance) in each iteration. Regression not currently supported.

[Decision tree](https://github.com/yflim/data-science-work-samples/tree/master/decision_tree)
- Basic implementation from scratch with support for both regression and classification.

[Random forest](https://github.com/yflim/data-science-work-samples/tree/master/random_forest)
- Basic implementation from scratch with support for both regression and classification. NOT REALLY TESTED YET.
